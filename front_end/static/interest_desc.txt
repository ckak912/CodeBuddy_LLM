Task Description:
In this task, you'll create a C program that calculates simple interest for a loan or investment. Simple interest is a fundamental concept in finance and a great exercise for beginner programmers.

Task Requirements:
Input Principal Amount: Implement a function called get_principal_amount that takes no arguments. Inside this function, set a predefined principal amount, e.g., $1000, and return this value.

Input Interest Rate: Implement a function called get_interest_rate that takes no arguments. Inside this function, set a predefined annual interest rate as a decimal (e.g., 0.05 for 5%), and return this value.

Input Time (in years): Implement a function called get_time_period that takes no arguments. Inside this function, set a predefined time period in years, e.g., 2 years, and return this value.

Calculate Simple Interest: Create a function called calculate_simple_interest that calculates and returns the simple interest based on the principal amount, interest rate, and time period. Use the formula: Simple Interest = Principal Amount * Annual Interest Rate * Time Period.

Display Result: In the main part of your program, call the above functions to input data and calculate the simple interest. Then, display the calculated simple interest.

This task allows you to practice defining functions, performing calculations, and displaying resultsâ€”all essential skills for a budding programmer. Plus, it's a practical concept you can apply in real-life financial situations. Happy coding!
