##Task Description:
Welcome, budding programmers! In this exercise, we're going to explore palindromesâ€”words or phrases that read the same forwards and backwards. Imagine words like "racecar" or phrases like "A man, a plan, a canal, Panama!" Your mission is to create a simple C program that can detect these fascinating patterns.

##Task Requirements:
Starting Point: You'll be given a set of predefined strings in the program. These are your "mystery" words or phrases. For example, you might see something like char *strings[] = {"Madam", "racecar", "A man, a plan, a canal: Panama", "Python", "level"}.

####Investigation: 
Your task is to write a C function called 'is_palindrome()' that examines each of these strings, returning 1 if the string is a palindrome or 0 if it isn't. To make your job easier, consider using the following C functions:

islower: Use this function to check if a character is a lowercase letter. It can help you handle uppercase/lowercase differences.

isalnum: This function checks if a character is an alphanumeric character (a letter or a digit). You can use it to filter out non-alphanumeric characters.

####Verdict: 
Once you've inspected each string, your program should deliver a verdict. If a string is a palindrome, your code should say, "This is a palindrome!" If it's not, your code should say, "This is not a palindrome."

####Helpful Tools: 
With the islower and isalnum functions, your code becomes more organized and can easily handle different cases. For example, it should recognize "Racecar" as a palindrome and disregard spaces and punctuation marks.

####Multiple Cases: 
You're not just solving one mystery here. Implement your code within a loop so that you can investigate multiple predefined strings, one after another. Be prepared for multiple puzzles!

This fun task will help you understand palindromes while sharpening your C programming skills. It's a puzzle that's about as challenging as our previous average grade calculator, making it an exciting step in your programming journey. So, gear up, detective, and let's solve some palindrome mysteries!
