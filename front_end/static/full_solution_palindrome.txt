# Step 1: Define a list of pre-defined strings to investigate for palindromes.
strings = ["Madam", "racecar", "A man, a plan, a canal: Panama", "Python", "level"]

# Step 2: Create a loop to iterate through each string in the list.
for string in strings:
    # Step 3: Inside the loop, remove spaces and punctuation marks from the current string.
    cleaned_string = ""
    for char in string:
        if char.isalnum():
            cleaned_string += char

    # Step 4: Convert the cleaned string to lowercase to ensure case-insensitivity.
    cleaned_string = cleaned_string.lower()

    # Step 5: Check if the cleaned lowercase string reads the same forward and backward.
    reversed_string = cleaned_string[::-1]
    if cleaned_string == reversed_string:
        # Step 6: If the string is a palindrome, print 'The word/phrase is a palindrome!'
        print(f"The word/phrase '{string}' is a palindrome!")
    else:
        # Step 7: If the string is not a palindrome, print 'The word/phrase is not a palindrome.'
        print(f"The word/phrase '{string}' is not a palindrome.")

    # Step 8: Continue the loop to investigate the next pre-defined string.

# Step 9: After investigating all strings, end the program.
